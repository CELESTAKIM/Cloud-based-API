The process of obtaining key.json for your Google Earth Engine (GEE) project involves creating a service account in the Google Cloud Console and generating a private key for it.
Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console üåê
Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Sign in with the same Google account you use for Google Earth Engine.

2. Create a New Project üìÇ
In the top-left corner, click the project dropdown.

Select New Project.

Give your project a name (e.g., "GEE-Dashboard"). This is just for organizational purposes within Google Cloud.

3. Create a Service Account ü§ñ
Once your new project is selected, navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts from the left-hand navigation menu.

Click + Create Service Account at the top.

Provide a service account name (e.g., gee-service-account). The ID will be automatically generated.

Click Done. You don't need to assign any roles at this stage.

4. Generate a JSON Key üîë
Find your newly created service account in the list.

Click on the three vertical dots (‚Åù) under the Actions column.

Select Manage keys.

Click Add Key > Create new key.

Choose JSON as the key type and click Create.

Your browser will download a JSON file. This file contains your private key and other credentials.

Rename this file to key.json and move it to the root directory of your project where your server.js file is located.

5. Authorize the Service Account in Earth Engine üåç
This is a critical step to grant your service account access to Earth Engine data and assets.

Open the Google Earth Engine Code Editor.

In the Assets tab, locate the asset you're using (in your case, projects/ee-celestakim019/assets/counties).

Click on the asset to open its details.

Go to the Permissions tab.

Under Share with others, paste the email address of the service account you just created (you can copy this from the Google Cloud Console).

Set the permission level to Reader.

Click Share.

Your key.json file is now ready to be used by your Node.js application to authenticate with the Google Earth Engine API.
